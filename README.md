## Introduction
Sometimes we believe we have the perfect potion to determine whether a company will be profitable or not. We analyze factors such as engagement, number of investors, amount of invested money, and financing rounds. However, like everything else, this process takes time and requires careful analysis.

After a fun and in-depth study of many of these factors, I can say that we can learn a lot about a company before pointing in a direction. There are factors that we do not even consider and many that we believe are important, but they are not so much.

Like all businesses, there are several customer profiles, and this analysis is no exception. We can clearly see the one who wants to find the successful company after much analysis. They do not care about the study time, and all they know is that they will bet on the winner. This profile is called PRECISION.

On the other hand, there is a more permissive profile that wants to have possible winners in their sights. They do not mind following a company that may not be a winner but can provide valuable learning opportunities. In monetary terms, this profile is capable of reducing its singular benefit by continuing to bet on the group of those that can prosper and those that are sure to be winners. This profile is called RECALL.

Based on this, I have come to the conclusion that two supervised learning models work for me. In one, I prioritize recall, and in the other, I prioritize precision.

## Data Quality
Like all analysis and studies, the more quality data you have, the more productive and beneficial it is for your model. Therefore, I will keep this study open, as it has much more to offer, and I am sure it will be helpful in many moments of uncertainty.

## Conclusion
This project takes a curious spin on predicting startups. By using a combination of precision and recall, we can learn a lot about a company before deciding whether to invest. The more quality data we have, the more accurate our predictions will be. Let's continue to explore and learn from this exciting field.
